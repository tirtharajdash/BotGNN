### Inclusion of Domain-Knowledge into GNNs using Mode-Directed Inverse Entailment

Graph Neural Network directly constructed from the Bottom-Clause generated by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). The resulting GNN models are to be known as "BotGNNs" (singular, "BotGNN").

##### Data

The present uncompressed version of our processed data constitutes almost 40GB. We will release these data as after the acceptance of our paper. However, in the mean time, we will release a sample dataset as an example.


#### Experiments

The MDIE implementation is carried out within [Aleph System](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/programinduction/Aleph/aleph.html).
The GNN implementations closely follow the implementations in [VEGNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13900). Also, VEGNN forms a yard-stick for comparison of BotGNNs.

The directory structure is a bit different here. We conduct numerous experiments in this work, over 80 different datasets and with 5 different variants of GNNs. Therefore, for convenience, we keep each experiment separately under each dataset directory. Please refer to the directory structure [here](https://github.com/tirtharajdash/BotGNN/blob/main/dirstr.md).

(More details on this repo will be added soon. Keep watching!!!)
